Modifications (January 14th 2024 @ 5:47 PM):
-> REMINDER: It's Elise's birthday in 2 days everyone! BAKA!
-> Hey Queenie, first you should go to VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web and become familiar with
   how VS Code is layed out and what the main windows are.
-> I'll give everyone else a quick rundown of how [WE] solved the error you were receiving. You don't have to worry about it!

Overview:
-> NodeJS is a back-end server, not a front-end.
-> We can use WebPack to bundle the application
-> The easiest way to get Queenie up and running in CodeSpaces is to serve the HTML with the built-in Node web server:

-> We recommend that you configure your own dev container to include all of the tools and scripts your project needs. This will ensure a fully reproducible environment for all GitHub Codespaces users in your repository.
